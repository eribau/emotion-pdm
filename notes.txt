pcm loudness: The loudness as the normalised intensity raised to a power of 0.3.

F0final: The smoothed fundamental frequency contour

F0finEnv: The envelope of the smoothed fundamental frequency contour.

voicingFinalUnclipped: The voicing probability of the final fundamental frequency candidate.
			Unclipped means, that it was not set to zero when is falls below the voicing threshold.

de: 1st order delta coefficient (differential) of the smoothed low-level descriptor

lpc: Linear predictive coding - Used for for representing the spectral envelope of a digital signal of speech in compressed form (wikipedia)

lps: Line spectral pairs 

linregc1: The slope (m) of a linear approximation of the contour

linreg2c: The offset (t) of a linear approximation of the contour
